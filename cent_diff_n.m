function df = cent_diff_n(f,h,n)
% df = cent_diff_n(f,h,n)
% Computes an n-point central difference of function f with spacing h.
% Returns a vector df of same size as f.
% Input f must be a vector with evenly spaced points.
% Input n must be 3,5,7, or 9.
% All three inputs are required.
%
% Differences for points near the edges are calculated with lower order.
% For example, if n=5 and length(f)=10, then 3-point central differencing is used
% to calculate values at points 2 and 9, 2-point forward differencing is used for
% point 1, 2-point backward differencing is used for point 10, and 5-point central
% differencing is used for points 3-7.
%
% If f contains less than n points, the order will be downgraded to the
% maximum possible.  Ex: if length(f) = 6, n will be downgraded to 5.
